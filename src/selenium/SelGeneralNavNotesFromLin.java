	 *  What's your biggest fear in Test Automation and why?

1. Flaky Tests – Tests failing randomly without clear reasons.
2. Maintenance Nightmare – Constantly updating scripts due to UI/API changes.
3. Slow Execution – Long-running test suites delaying feedback.
4. False Positives/Negatives – Tests passing/failing incorrectly, leading to mistrust.
