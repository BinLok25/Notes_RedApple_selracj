	 * 
	 * useractions,keyboard actions
	 * useractions can be automated with the help of actions class
	 * 
	 * Scenario:
	 * handle the scenario when we mouse over, some other eles also are going to appear
	 * ==> they are hidden
	 * 
	 * we should go with the text() always as visible on the page
	 * 
	 * create the obj ref of actions class-by passing the driver as parameter, then
	 * using the obj ref dot specificActionMethod available from the actions class
	 * 
	 * there are two ways:
	 * i) whenever we r using single action just dot perform
	 * ii) for multiple actions--then build().perform()
	 * ==> build is collecting all actions together so as to perform
	 * 
	 * Build() : returns only action variable
	 * 
	 * perform(): 
	 * 
	 * RightClick()/contextclick()
