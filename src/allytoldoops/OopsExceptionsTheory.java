	 * 
	 * the above situation is taken care of one and only try--catch block
	 * ultimately
	 * 
	 * throws key word: to toss the exception from one method to another
	 * and finally it reaches the main method where it is caught by jvm
	 * BUT again ultimately this needs a try - catch block again to be
	 * halted and program moves further
	 * 
	 * throw: is used to custom create users own exception
