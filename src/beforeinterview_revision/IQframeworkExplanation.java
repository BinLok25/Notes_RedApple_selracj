	 * Imp Question: Explain Your Selenium Automation Framework?


ðŸ”¹ Framework Type â€“ I use a Hybrid Framework, combining Data-Driven Testing, Page Object Model (POM), and Utility Methods to ensure scalability and reusability.

ðŸ”¹ Tech Stack â€“ Built with Selenium (Java), TestNG for test execution, Maven for dependency management, and POM for better maintainability.

ðŸ”¹ Core Components
âœ… Base Class â€“ Manages WebDriver initialization, waits, and browser configurations.
âœ… Page Classes (POM) â€“ Stores locators and reusable methods for better test maintainability.
âœ… Test Classes â€“ Contains structured test cases using TestNG.
âœ… Utilities â€“ Handles screenshots, Excel data, and API calls for reusability.
âœ… Reporting â€“ Generates detailed reports using Extent Reports or Allure.
âœ… Logging & Debugging â€“ Uses Log4j and TestNG reports for better traceability.

ðŸ”¹ CI/CD Integration â€“ Designed to run tests seamlessly in Jenkins or GitHub Actions, ensuring smooth execution in CI/CD pipelines.

ðŸ”¹ Test Data Handling â€“ Supports Excel, JSON, or database connections for dynamic test data management.

With this framework design, test automation becomes efficient, scalable, and maintainable.
