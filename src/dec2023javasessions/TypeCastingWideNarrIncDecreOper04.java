	 * dataTypecasting: converting one data type to another data type
	 * 
	 * Types Of DataTypes:
	 * ----------
	 *   Primitive or Fundamental Data Types
	 *   Referenced or Advanced Data Types
	 *   
	 * Casting Primitive Data Type
	 * ---------
	 *   Widening: Converting a lower data type into higher data type is
	 *   called widening
	 *   
	 *   Narrowing: Converting a higher data type into lower data type is
	 *   called narrowing
	 *   
	 *   with Narrowing: will lose some data
	 *   
	 *   Inc and Decre Operators:
	 *   -----
	 *   ++  increase the value by 1
	 *   --  decrease the value by 1
	 *   
	 *   cannot write ++++ or ----
	 *  char  byte  short   int  long  float  double
	 *   <------------------------------------------>
	 *   
	 *   10++ errs/wrong syntax--cannot apply ++/-- directly on value
	 *   only can be applied on the variable
	 *   
	 *   on boolean cannot apply inc and decrement operators
	 *   
	 *   on String cannot apply incre and decrement operators
	 * 
	 * 
	 * TRICK: WITH pre-increment
	 * ---Both the vars will have same value
	 * 
	 * With post-increment-the values diff
	 * 
	 * post-decrement:
	 * 
	 * System.out.println(10++);//wrong syntax - cannot apply inc operator to value
	 *
