	 * 
	 * Arrays.asList(); -- always gives a dynamic list--cannot say Arrays - a static
	 * array
	 * 
	 * is class a type?? yes
	 * 
	 * for strings: no need to import since it is such a common class
	 * 
	 * String str = "Hello"; //declaration of obj without a name
	 * String t = new String("hello") //declaration with ref name --
	 *  //String should not be created using new key word because of the
	 * 	REASON:
	 * 
	 * //category - blueprint - class - prototype, template
	 *  //instance
	 *  //Human --class --properties: name, eyes address, nose, height
	 *  //Laptop --class: name, size, color, price
	 *  
	 *  when .sort() method applied it will sort => shuffle the original
	 *  list and index gets changed
	 *  
	 *  removeAll() -- asks for a parameter which is a collection format
	 *  ==> any list
	 * 
	 * 
	 * NoRefObjs: never create-since-it occupies unnecessary space
	 * in the memory
	 * every time u create such obj-memory is wasted making GC come
	 * into the heap and destroy these objs -- without ref names
	 * 
	 * GOOD PRACTICE: always create obj's with ref names
	 * which gets a copy of all the class vars
