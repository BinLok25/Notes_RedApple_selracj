	 * 
	 * exception:
	 * ---------
	 * some specific unwanted code written by us -- leads to 
	 * the termination of the program
	 * --this unexpected behavior which is terminating the program is
	 * called exception--could be at compile time/run time
	 * the wrong code leading to the termination of the program
	 * 
	 * ---needs to be handled properly so as to continue the execution
	 * of the program -- can be done using -try...catch block, throws
	 * key word=>throws interrupted exception
	 * 
	 * catch() -- is not a method BUT is a block
	 * for every EXCEPTION there is a pre-defined class created in JAVA
	 * -in this block we can do the REPORTING about the exception
	 * 
	 * printStackTrace() -- will automatically say what type of exception
	 * is coming 
	 * 
	 * AND then the next lines of code will also be executed
	 * 
	 * error:
	 * -----the syntactical mistakes in the code leads to errors
	 * it doesnot represent any code logic
	 * e.gs: memory issue, ram issue ==> infrastructure behaaviour
	 * 
	 * 
	 * try...catch: always paired together -- cannot write try without
	 * catch block -- starts to err
	 * 
	 * EXCEPTION: this class has n no. of child classes
	 * above exception -- there is throwable --under throwable - 2 child
	 * classes exception + error
	 * 
	 * with one single try.....multiple catch blocks allowed by java
	 *
