	 * GraphQL Notes:
	 * ---------------->>
	 * graphQL -- is a query language for your API and a server-side runtime for
	 * executing those queries by using a type system that you define for your data
	 * 
	 * GraphQL was developed by Facebook in 2012 and released as an open source prj
	 * in 2015
	 * 
	 * key concepts of GraphQl:
	 * ------------->
	 * 1.Schema: in graphQl you define a schema that outlines the types of data available
	 * in your API including their relationships and the operations that can be performed
	 * on them
	 * 
	 * 2.Query: Clients can request exactly the data they need using a query, which is a
	 * JSON- like structure: specifying the fields and relationships desired. This 
	 * eliminates over-fetching or under-fetching of data
	 * 
	 * 3.Mutation: Mutations are used to modify data on the server. They allow clients to
	 * create, update, or delete data through a structural set of operations
	 * 
	 * 4.SubScription: Subscription enable real-time communication between the client and
	 * the server. Clients can subscribe to specific events and receive updates when those
	 * events occur
	 * 
	 * polling: keep calling to chk if data is there or not
	 * 
	 *
