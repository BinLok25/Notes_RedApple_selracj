	 * *What are the most asked Coding problems in Test Automation Engineer Interviews?*



Master these Topics to crack your next Test Automation Interview. Practicing these concepts will definitely help you to get your basics right.

Most companies, even before conducting technical interviews focuses on Coding rounds.
Here are some common logic programs that you might encounter in a QA Automation Interview (If you code using Java)

Core Java Concepts:
↳ String Manipulation:
 * Reversing a string
 * Palindromes
 * Counting vowels or consonants
 * Finding the longest/shortest word
↳ Array Manipulation:
 * Finding the largest/smallest element
 * Sorting arrays (bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort, merge sort, quick sort)
 * Reversing an array
 * Finding duplicates
 * Finding longest substring
 * Finding repetitive substrings
 * Finding second smallest/largest element
↳ Number Operations:
 * Prime number check
 * Fibonacci series
 * Factorial calculation
 * Armstrong number check
↳ Data Structures:
 * Implementing basic data structures like linked lists, stacks, queues
 * Traversing and searching in these structures
↳ OOP Concepts:
 * Inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, abstraction
 * Creating abstract classes and interfaces

↳ Pro-Tip: 
➦ Practice Regularly
➦ Solve coding challenges on platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank
➦ Understand the Underlying Concepts
➦ Don't just memorise solutions, understand the logic behind them
➦ Write Clean and Efficient Code
➦ Pay attention to code readability and optimisation
➦ Test Thoroughly
➦ Write unit tests to ensure your code works as expected
➦ Stay Updated
➦ Keep up with the latest trends and technologies in the automation field
