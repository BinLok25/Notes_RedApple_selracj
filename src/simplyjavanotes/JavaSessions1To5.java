	* there are 53 keywords in java-all should be written in lower case

	*

	* Main(): is the entry point for java programming

	* DataType: means the type of Data in laymans language

	* --like boolean, string type, int, double...etc

	*

	* JAVA: is a strict data type language==> cannot create a var without declaring the data

	* type for the variable-will ERR

	*

	* DATA TYPES: are TWO -primitive and NON primitive

	* Whenever we declare the data types-2 imp things need to be mentioned-size and range

	* size-in memory the unit is bytes and bits

	* 1 byte=8 bits

	* range- is what is the min value and max value that we can store in a variable

	* -128 to 127

	* 1.primitive: will not have to create the object - will take fixed space in memory

	* primitive data types--divided into integral and float

	* 1.Numeric type:

	*   a. Integral value:

	*     a.1: integer: byte, short, int, long

	*     a.2: floating-type: float, double

	*   b. Charater:characters are also numeric in JAVA************************imp

	*

	* 2.Boolean type:

	*   boolean true/false

	*

	* a.1.1 byte:

	* size: 1 byte = 8 bits

	* range: -128 to 127

	*

	* e.g: byte b = 10;

	* b = 20;

	* b = 30;

	* system.out.println(b);

	*

	* a.1.2 short:

	* size: 2 bytes = 16 bits

	* range:-32768 to 32768

	*

	* a.1.3 int:

	* size: 4 bytes = 32 bits

	* range:-2147483648 to 2147483647

	*

	* a.1.4 long:

	* size: 8 bytes = 64 bits

	* range:-9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807

	*

	* e.gs: telPhNo, SSN, aadhar card, acc no, CC

	*

	* a.2.1 float:

	* size:

	* range:

	*

	* a.2.2 double:

	* size:

	* range:

	*

	* whenever u r adding two bytes-always store the resultant in int and not short

	*

	* 2.Boolean: true/false

	*

	*

	* 2.non-primitive: need to create the object(oops) - will have to talk about String,classes,arrays,

	* interfaces....etc==> we have to play with the object

	*

	* String: is a class soo non-primitive data type

	*

	* OOPs: JAVA is not 100 percent object oriented because of primitive data types

	* as we can declare variables without objects also

	*

	* revision:

	* ASCII values range

	* a to z : 97 - 122

	* A to Z : 65 - 90

	* 0 to 9 : 48 - 57

	* ' ' : 32

	*

	* use byte, short, int, long vars only if performing mathematical operations
	* Else just for storing purpose -- use the String class-for storing telephone
	* no, aadhar card, pan card, SSn etc

	*

	* SESSION:3

	* -----------------------------

	* String: is a non-primitive data type and it is a class-already existing in Java library

	* is a collection of multiple characters

	* how to declare a string: in double quotes

	* for character there is an ascii value but not for a string

	*

	* String Concatination: merging two Strings-can be done with Strings and ints as well

	*

	* + : when used in between two Strings-acts as a concatenation operator

	* + : when used in between two vars/no.s - acts as an addition operator

	*

	* ASCII: values taken by default ONLY for characters in JAVA

	*

	*

	* WIDENING: /implicit typecasting

	*

	* NARROWING:/explicit typecasting
